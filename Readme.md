# Whisper Hebrew: A finetuned version of the Open-AI Speech recognition whisper model
**Work In progress**

This is a finetuned version of the Whisperr TTS model by Open-AI. 
The original model's performance in hebrew is lacking - this is an attempt to create a better performing model using quick and simple finetune with a relatively small dataset.
